About this repo:

Django web app  designed to generate ticket support. Used often in IT departments. 
It can be also used for other request types. 

This app contains also code from the famous library django-river. To develop this workflow I used the Django-river Jira example.

The user of smart drop downs might come in new updates. It is certainly not the strongest point in Django.

Django version used (1.10-11)
